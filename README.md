# tf-regression
A simple implementation for regression problems using Python 2.7 and TensorFlow. Bulk of code from [PythonProgramming.net](www.pythonprogramming.net) with further enhancements including cost function tracking and elastic net regularisation from [TensorFlow Machine Learning Cookbook](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook) by @nfmcclure

[train_test_data.py](train_test_data.py) is a script that preprocesses a data file into the necessary arrays for TensorFlow
[train_neural_network.py](train_neural_network.py) contains the steps to build and evaluate a TensorFlow neural network
